        <p>This map uses Yelp API data to show Asian cafe's in the Atlanta, Georgia region.
            I used the Yelp API Crawler from the previous GEOG450 class and modified it to
            take the data I wanted. I chose this because I visit my family frequently and I
            thought it would be cool to map out a variety of cafes/restaurants to take my family to
            This map was created for my own personal use, however the concept of it applies to
            anyone interested in the region looking for cafes to visit. I color-coded the markers
            based on the average Yelp ratings received for each business and created an
            interactive slider that filters out businesses based on if they meet a certain rating
            threshold. I also added county boundaries to visualize where highly-rated cafes
            were in each county and added lines showing how far my family members live
            away from the family home. All the layers are toggleable and the markers show pop-up content about the cafes.</p>
